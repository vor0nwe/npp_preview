v1.2.0.0, 2013-01-26

- Added: when changing the document, the preview is automatically refreshed. [20d1203257]
         By default, the plugin waits for 1000 ms (= 1 second), but this can be adjusted by 
		 creating a settings file "$(PLUGINSCONFIG)\PreviewHTML\Settings.ini", and adding the 
		 following lines to it, replacing 1000 by the number of milliseconds you want it to wait.
		 If you want to disable the autorefresh, specify an interval of 0 ms.
		 
		 [Autorefresh]
		 Interval=1000
